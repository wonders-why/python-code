# My Coding Journey – Early Projects

This is an old repository of mine. It doesn’t showcase anything particularly noble or a major milestone, but it represents a part of my growth through my coding journey.  

The code here is messy and unstructured, but it’s where I started exploring, experimenting, and learning. You’re free to browse through it—you might notice mistakes, unoptimized solutions, and inconsistent structure.  

I keep this repository visible not as a showcase of achievement, but as a **souvenir** of where my journey began. It’s a reminder of how far I’ve come and a testament to the process of learning, trial, and error.  

Feel free to look, learn, or even laugh at the messy beginnings—this is all part of the journey.
