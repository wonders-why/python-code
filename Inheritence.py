#inheritence, super funtion, inheriting parents function and constructors

        # super function is used to inherit the parent constructor values like self.name = name.
        # We donâ€™t have to write self.name = name here because we inherited it from above using super().
        super().__init__(name)

print(s1.display() + s1.degree)

# So far, this is how we inherit the class from one to another.
# The super() method in the child class constructor is important to actually inherit parent constructor code.
# The __init__ function gets overridden, and all other functions with the same name will get overridden by new functions in Student.
