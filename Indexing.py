#this file is here specifically to understand the slicing and indexing of strings, and data structures

a_list = [1, 2, 3, "HI", "I", "Am", "A", "list"]

#normal indexing
print(a_list[3])

#negitive idexing
print(a_list[-5])

#specifying the range
print(a_list[3:8])

#There was actually no need to write 8 as the empty value means till the end.
print(a_list[3:])

#It works the same in case of opposite side
print(a_list[:3])

#now lets use negive indexing in same way
print(a_list[-5:])

print(a_list[:-5])

"""This is all to it combining all thesse together can help u use the data structures and array in efficient manner as per needs"""
